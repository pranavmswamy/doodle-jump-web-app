            <h1> DOODLE JUMP </h1>
            <p>Doodle Jump is a platforming video game developed and published by American studio Lima Sky. The initial release of the game was in April 2009.
                In Doodle Jump, the aim is to guide a four-legged creature called "The Doodler" up a never-ending series of platforms without falling.
                Players can get a short boost from various objects, such as propeller hats, jetpacks, rockets, springs, trampolines.

            <h4> Reinforcement Learning </h4>

            Our goal to build a AI player model that interacts with the game and allows the doodler to climb up the platforms.
            We wish to explore a combination of computer vision and reinforcement learning agents like DQN, PPO and A3C.

                <p> Challenges: </p>
                <ul class="nes-list is-disc">
                <li>Dynamicity of environment (moving and breakable platforms, and random rewards).</li> <br>
                <li>The game is not episodic in nature (not consistently repetitive).</li> <br>
                <li>Game environment is not exposed to us via APIs, so we need to use external libraries to interact with the game.</li>

            <h4> Adversarial Attack </h4>
                Adversarial attacking is a machine learning technique that attempts to fool models by supplying deceptive input that looks similar to the human eye.
            This part of our project is mainly to look into possibilities of eliminating players using game bots to deceive Anti-cheat engines.  
            Our goal is to research on building a neural network that would manipulate the input image sent to reinforcement learning system to confuse the game bot.
